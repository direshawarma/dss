"Frivolous and unnecessary" -- the reanimated corpse of Roger Ebert, 2236

dss is a bot for discord that started out as a webscraper. This project is an entirely unnecessary useage of Rust and if
the goal of this project was to make a bot the smart way it would be done in a much higher level language.

So why Rust, then? Because I wanted to learn some Rust, and implementing concepts I'm familiar with in new languages is
a great way for me to build an understanding

it will get an eclectic assortment of features over time.

### Implemented Features

* ~~webscraping~~ downloaded html scraping
    * but not the web part yet
* the barest bones of database handling
* I enabled gitlab webhoooks for the discord channel so i guess that's something even if it's not actually part of the
  bot but a feature of git

### Features of the *Future*

* almost all of them
* seriously this bot is unuseable in its current state
* oh god i've bit off more than I can chew, haven't I?
* oh right this is public now - no more dark, shadowy back-alley version control for us, nosiree

### Features of the Past

* error handling now eliminates `unwrap()`-and-pray debugging
* `Null`
* caring if spelling/grammar are done good in things
